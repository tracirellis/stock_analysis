VBA- Challenge - Stock Analysis
Assignment Ask - o creat a script that loops through all the stocks for one year an outputs the following information: The Ticker Symbol, Yearly Change from the opening price to the closing Price at the end of that year; the percentage chang from the opening price at the beginning of a year to the closing price at the end of that year and the total stock volume of each stock. In addition the ask was to add functionality to your script and return the stocks with the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease and the Greatest Total Volume. and Make sure that the VBA Script runs on every worksheet.
Included for the assignment you will find the ScreenShots for Each Year, The XLSM file for the Stock Analysis, the Read Me as well as the Code (hopefully I Saved it correctly)
How I came up with the Script and Coding for the assignment: To determine how I was going to complete the assignment, I worked with AskBCS, I had a Tutoring Session, I asked Questions in Class, I used coding that was for other assignments and manipulated the code to adjust to the current assignment, Specfically the Credit Card Assignment as well as the Census Assignment Really helped. We also went over some of the possible codes that we might use while in class. I also used the following to assist in checking my code whenever my code broke: Google, ChatGPT, Microsoft Websites and other websites where I could compare what I did with others just to ensure I was in line with getting it right.
Challenges with the assignment- I have never used VBA/Macros before or wrote with them, so it was a challenge trying to manipulate some of the code and understanding the particular order, but once I got on a AskBCS session I was actually able to find my own issues with the coding a couple of times so those really helped.
